    logging. Neither is undone by ``monkeypatch``, so a test that boots
    an app under a different ``ENV`` would otherwise leave every later
    test in the session running against the wrong logging profile.

    structlog's processor *list object* is restored by identity, not

    place, and loggers cached before the swap hold a reference to it.
